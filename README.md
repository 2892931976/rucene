Rust implementation of Lucene
=====================================================================================

## Full-text search for Rust

Rucene is a Rust port of the popular Apache Lucene project. Rucene is not a complete application, but rather a code library and API that can easily be used to add search capabilities to applications.

## Status
Rucene (index searcher part) has been put into production and served all search traffics at Zhihu since 2018.06. Development of index writer was started later in late 2018 and was put into production to serve realtime searching since 2019.05.

## Documentation
We don't yet have API documentation for Rucene, but the API is similar to [Lucene 6.2.1](https://lucene.apache.org/core/6_2_1/). 
> NOTE: We are working on this, but could use more help since it is a massive project.

## License
Rucene is under the Apache 2.0 license. See the [LICENSE](./LICENSE) file for details.
